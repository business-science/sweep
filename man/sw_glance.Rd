}
\details{
\code{sw_glance()} is a wrapper for \code{\link[broom:reexports]{broom::glance()}}. The benefit of \code{sw_glance}
is that it has methods for various time-series model classes such as
\code{HoltWinters}, \code{ets}, \code{Arima}, etc.
\code{sw_glance} methods always return either a one-row tibble or \code{NULL}.
The single row includes summary statistics relevent to the model accuracy,
which can be used to assess model fit and quality.

For non-time series, \code{sw_glance()} defaults to \code{\link[broom:reexports]{broom::glance()}}.
The only difference is that the return is a tibble.
