> Extending `broom` to time series forecasting

The `sweep` package extends the `broom` tools (tidy, glance, and augment) for performing forecasts and time series analysis in the "tidyverse". The package is geared towards "tidying" the forecast workflow used with Rob Hyndman's `forecast` package. 

## Benefits

* __Designed for modeling and scaling forecasts using the the `tidyverse` tools in [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)__
* __Extends `broom` for model analysis (ARIMA, ETS, BATS, etc)__
* __Tidies the `forecast` objects for easy plotting and "tidy" data manipulation__
* __Integrates `timetk` to enable dates and datetimes (irregular time series) in the tidied forecast output__


## Tools

The package contains the following elements:

1. __model tidiers__: `sw_tidy`, `sw_glance`, `sw_augment`, `sw_tidy_decomp` functions extend `tidy`, `glance`, and `augment` from the `broom` package specifically for models (`ets()`, `Arima()`, `bats()`, etc) used for forecasting. 

2. __forecast tidier__: `sw_sweep` converts a `forecast` object to a tibble that can be easily manipulated in the "tidyverse".


## Making forecasts in the tidyverse

`sweep` enables converting a `forecast` object to `tibble`. The result is ability to use `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot` natively to manipulate, analyze and visualize forecasts.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("tools/forecast.png")
```

## Forecasting multiple time series groups at scale

Often forecasts are required on grouped data to analyse trends in sub-categories. The good news is scaling from one time series to many is easy with the various `sw_` functions in combination with `dplyr` and `purrr`.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("tools/time_series_groups.png")
```

## Forecasting multiple models for accuracy

A common goal in forecasting is to compare different forecast models against each other. `sweep` helps in this area as well.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("tools/multiple_models.png")
```

## broom extensions for forecasting

If you are familiar with `broom`, you know how useful it is for retrieving "tidy" format model components. `sweep` extends this benefit to the `forecast` package workflow with the following functions:

* `sw_tidy`: Returns model coefficients (single column)
* `sw_glance`: Returns accuracy statistics (single row) 
* `sw_augment`: Returns residuals 
* `sw_tidy_decomp`: Returns seasonal decompositions
* `sw_sweep`: Returns tidy forecast outputs. 

The compatibility chart is listed below.

```{r, echo = F}
tibble::tribble(
    ~Object,       ~`sw_tidy()`, ~`sw_glance()`, ~`sw_augment()`, ~`sw_tidy_decomp()`, ~`sw_sweep()`,
